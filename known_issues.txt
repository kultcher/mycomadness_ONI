- Mycofiber Tile not showing up in codex
- Move string declarations (and tag?) from assets patch

Notes:
- SimCellOccupier SetupDescriptor seems to be where movement speed bonuses are tooltipped?
- UI.cs maybe where to change build menu sublabels?
- Can use go.AddorGet<ElementEmitter> or <ElementDropper>
- outputElement has offsets

TODO:
- add seed logic to Tar Funnel
- add fast rotting to raw Mycofiber
- add mycotecture scaffolding
- tweak various numbers
- tweak steam output location for tar funnel
- add Tar Funnel strings
- swap out placeholder graphics
- Add search terms for buildings?
- Fix "Label" sub-tag on Mycofiber tile in build menu
