### Oxygen Not Included mod

This mod will add 3 new non-food plants with some interesting mechanical twists and challenges.

Acknowledgements:
I'm a relatively novice coder and this is my first mod. So big thanks to the ONI modding community, whose mods I borrowed code from liberally and whose tools I used (Kanim Explorer, kanimal) Special thanks to Ronivan (RIP) whose mods I used to as a template for custom elements and plants.

Dislcaimer:
This mod currently uses AI generated art concepted by me, with some customatizations and animations that I've added.
I am not an artist, nor can I afford to pay one. I feel that adding these unique plants with recolored base game or other placeholder art would degrade the play experience.
If any artists or animators would be interested in contributing, I'd love to collaborate, but I can't offer any compensation.
